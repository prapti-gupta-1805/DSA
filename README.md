# DSA Notes

This repository contains code implementations and notes related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in **Java** and **C**. It is aimed at understanderstanding various data structures and algorithm concepts by providing detailed code implementations and explanations.

  ## Contents

The repository is organized into different sections for better clarity:

- **Java**: Java-based code and implementations.
- **C**: Basic C-based code and implementations.

Each directory will contain code for various algorithms and data structures such as arrays, linked lists, sorting algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.

  ## Getting Started

To use the code or notes:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/prapti-gupta-1805/DSA-Notes.git

2. Navigate to the respective folder for Java or C code:
   - Java code can be found in the `/Java` directory.
   - C code can be found in the `/C` directory.

3. You can compile and run the code as per your requirement using an IDE or compiler of your choice.
