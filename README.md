# DSA Notes

This repository contains code implementations and notes related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in **Java**, **C** and **Python**. It is aimed at understanderstanding various data structures and algorithm concepts by providing detailed code implementations and explanations.

  ## Contents

The repository is organized into different sections for better clarity:

- **Java**: Java-based code and implementations.
- **C**: Basic C-based code and implementations.
-  **Python**: Python-based code and implementations.

Each directory will contain code for various algorithms and data structures such as arrays, linked lists, sorting algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.
