Time Complexity:
Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. It's typically expressed in terms of the big O notation (O(f(n))).
eg. O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²), O(2ⁿ), O(n!)
Space Complexity:
Space complexity measures the amount of memory space an algorithm uses as a function of the input size.
